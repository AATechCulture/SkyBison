General

    Your ticket is only valid for the specific flights and routes listed on it.
    If you have a ticket without a set date, or you want to change your travel date, you won't get special treatment when trying to book a new flight.

Arrival and Boarding

    You need to be at the gate 30 minutes before your flight's departure time. The gate closes 10 minutes before departure.

Conditions for Reservations

    Your reservation is confirmed when the airline's reservation agent enters it into their system. You need to get a validated ticket at least 60 minutes before your flight.
    If you buy your ticket two or more days before your departure from American Airlines directly, you can get a refund within 24 hours of purchase. After that, regular refund rules apply.

Rules for Confirming Reservations

    Making fake or abusive reservations is not allowed. This includes holding seats for a lower price, rewards, or upgrades, or trying to cheat the airline's fare rules.
    You can't make duplicate or impossible reservations, like booking two flights on the same day from the same place.

Overbooking

    Sometimes the airline might sell more tickets than there are seats. If you have a confirmed reservation but can't get on the flight, you might get compensation.

Seat Allocation

    The airline doesn't promise you a specific seat on the plane.

Cancellation of Reservations

    The airline can cancel your reservation if there's a government rule, emergency, or bad weather.
    If you're flying internationally, you need to give some extra information, and if you don't, your reservation might be canceled.

Time Limit for Getting a Ticket

    You need to get a validated ticket at least 60 minutes before your flight leaves.

Communication Charges

    If you ask for special help with your reservation, you might have to pay for extra communication costs.

Minimum Check-In Time

    You need to be checked in at least 45 minutes before your flight if you're flying within the United States.

    If you're flying internationally, you need to be checked in 60 minutes before your flight.

    Different airports might have different rules, so be sure to check.

Specific Airports

    Some specific airports might have longer check-in times. For example, if you're flying from San Juan, Puerto Rico, you need to be checked in 60 minutes before your flight.

American Airlines Shuttle

    If you're flying between Boston, New York LaGuardia, and Washington, DC Reagan, you need to be checked in 30 minutes before your flight if you have a checked bag, or 20 minutes before if you don't.
