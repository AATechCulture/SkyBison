# QuickBook

## Challenge Statement(s) Addressed 🎯
How might we make the process for rebooking flights due to unexpected delays or cancelations seamless for our customers? How would we also help the customer acquire another flight if they absolutely need to be at their desired destination?  

## Project Description 🤯
During any type of cancellation, delay, or missed flights our application provides information about other flights from other airlines (given the fact that the user NEEDS to get to their destination ASAP…) while still providing incentives for people to American. The application handles baggage information relieving the information desk.

## Project Value 💰
Our application relieves the information desk.
It increases customer satisfaction (take an example at SouthWest).
It increases customer retention (shows that American cares about their customer's time).
